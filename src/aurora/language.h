/** Pre-parse and fix color codes found in UI and dialogue strings in Aurora games.
 *
 *  Aurora games (or Neverwinter Nights at least) allow for color codes of the
 *  form "<c???>" (and closing with "</c>"). The ??? are direct byte values taken
 *  as red, green and blue values, breaking the usual text encoding.
 *
 *  To fix that, we pre-parse those strings, converting "<c???>" into "<cXXXXXX>",
 *  where XXXXXX are the byte values in hexadecimal notation.
 *
 *  Note that this function will only work for encodings where ASCII values are
 *  directly encoded as ASCII. Namely, ASCII, Latin9, UTF-8, Windows CP-1250,
 *  Windows CP-1252 and many of the variable-byte Windows codepages used for
 *  Asian languages. This function will *not* work for UTF-16 and UTF-32.
 *
 *  Also note that we're hoping that "<c???>" won't collide with valid characters
 *  inside multibyte sequences. This is reasonable likely to never happen.
